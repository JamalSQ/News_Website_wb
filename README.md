**Prerequisites:**

* PHP and a web server (like Apache) installed on your system.

**Steps:**

1. Clone this repository:

2. Create a database:

   - Use a tool like phpMyAdmin or a command-line tool to create a database for your website.
   - (Optional) If you have an SQL script to set up the database schema with user roles and permissions, import it now.

3. Configure database connection (**Important**):

   - Edit the PHP configuration files (e.g., `config.php`) to provide your database connection details (hostname, username, password, database name).

4. Configure user roles and permissions (**Important**):

   - Implement logic in your PHP code to handle user roles and access control based on their login credentials.

5. Place project files:

   - Copy the project files to your web server's document root directory (usually `htdocs` for Apache).

**Running the Website:**

- Open your web browser and navigate to the directory where you placed the project files (e.g., http://localhost/your-project-folder/).
