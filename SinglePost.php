                <b>The UN's top court has ordered Israel to enable the unhindered flow of aid into Gaza in order to avert a famine.
                </b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>In a unanimous decision, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said Israel had to act "without delay" to allow the "provision... of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance".
                    This follows warnings that famine could hit Gaza within weeks.
                    Israel has called allegations it is blocking aid "wholly unfounded".
                    Giving its response to the court order, the Israeli foreign ministry said it was continuing "to promote new initiatives, and to expand existing ones" to allow a continuous flow of aid into Gaza "by land, air and sea", working with the UN and others.
